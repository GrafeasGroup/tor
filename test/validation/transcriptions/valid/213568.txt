*Video Transcription:*

(00:00) [*An excerpt from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of The Sith. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker are sitting in some kinda of opera and are talking to each other. Both are wearing long black robes. The original audio has been replaced by a different dialog, slightly modified from the original. A dark ominous music is playing in the background.*]

**Palpatine**: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Cloakknight the Wise?

(00:08) [*The shot cuts to a view behind Palpatine and Anakin, showing parts of the \"opera\". A mysterious bubble can be seen, with multiple red and blue shapes flowing around inside of it.*]

**Anakin**: No.

**Palpatine**: I thought not. It's not a story Redditors would tell you.
It's a Mod legend.

(00:22) [*It cuts back to show Palpatine and Anakin from the front.*]

**Palpatine**: Cloakknight was a Dark Lord of the Mods so powerful and so wise he could use his power
to remove any posts in the queue containing... [*He turns his head towards Anakin.*] PI.

**Palpatine**: He had such a knowledge of transcribing
he could even save the ones he cared about
from a ban.

**Anakin**: [*Turning to Palpatine:*] He could actually... identify PI?

(00:56) [*A close-up of Palpatine's face is shown.*]

**Palpatine**: Becoming a transcriber is a pathway to many abilities
some consider to be... unnatural.

(01:06) [*Close-up of Anakin, looking slightly confused, but intrigued.*]

**Anakin**: Wh-What happened to him?

**Palpatine**: [*Smiling:*] He became so powerful
the only thing he was afraid of was... [*He nods.*] losing his power
which eventually, of course, he did.

**Palpatine:** Unfortunately, he tried to do a 500/24
then Altrissa banned him in his sleep.

(01:31) [*A close-up of Palpatine's face is shown again. He slightly shakes his head and stares into the distance as in deep in thought.*]

**Palpatine**: It's ironic.
He could save others from a ban
but not himself.

(01:40) [*The music becomes darker, with a sense of danger to it.*]

**Anakin**: Is it possible to learn this power?

**Palpatine**: [*In a slightly different voice, because I did a poor job mixing the audio:*] Not from a Redditor.

(01:51) [*End of video.*]
