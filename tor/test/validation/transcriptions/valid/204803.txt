I've mentioned this a bit before but as someone who spends a lot of time thinking about and discussing RWBY and has gone to great lengths to critique it in fine detail, it is absolutely BIZARRE to see the way that the show's most vocal haters talk about it. Like this show has so many goddamn problems that are so, so, easy to identify, but it feels like the people most committed to talking about how bad the show is ignore all of these and spend their time making up fake bullshit problems that don't matter

"this isn't what Monty would have wanted"

how the fuck do you know what he would have wanted? What are you a fuckin medium or something? You gave monty a call and he told you that he thinks the show's gone to shit? Literally you have no way of knowing because no one has any way of knowing except the people at Rooster Teeth he left his notes with.

"bumbleby is forced and pandering to shippers"

first of all, they haven't even kissed yet, second of all, if RWBY wanted to pander to shippers I can think of three characters they could have not killed. also why do you care.

"Yang is a bad person because she didn't thank Ironwood for giving her the new arm"

this show is short enough on time as is, what purpose does it really serve to have a throwaway line where Yang says "thanks for the arm btw!" if it doesn't tie into anything else that happens from that point on in the story. also literally who cares

"Adam had so much wasted potential"

And Sienna didn't????

"Emerald didn't deserve to be redeemed, she's literally responsible for people's deaths!"

and absolutely nothing has happened to her character since then

I feel like, to people who aren’t in this silly little fandom, the lengths people go to to defend this mess of a show probably seems absolutely deranged but when most of the popular criticism you see is the most poorly thought out bad faith dogshit imaginable at some point I don’t even blame people for just drowning out the negative takes entirely. and the fact that it’s like this blows my fucking mind because how do you devote so much of your time to hating this show and go to great lengths to *invent* reasons why it’s bad instead of just being like “who thought catgirl racism was a good idea”
