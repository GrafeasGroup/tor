I had to come here to vent because I'm scared and sad .... my  300sqft camper that I birthed my son in unassisted has been "under construction" for two months and I'm due in November and wanted to start an outdoor space before baby came so I could move more freely and privately ... my baby daddy has destroyed all the building supplies $3k+ worth of lumber and insulation left in a big storm instead of being brought inside ... he's been getting drunk and sleeping there instead of working and I've been working full time and doing all the meal prep and laundry and shopping and managing the kids schedules while homeschooling and he doesn't do anything but game and smoke and drink and I have no help or support - not to mention there's an assault charge against him for abusing me now which means CPS is involved and that's stressful itself .... we're homeless and having authorities questioned our whole lives and I have no family or friends and all my energy and money is SPENT doing literally EVERYTHING alone and paying for babysitting... baby daddy won't shower or eat at all hasn't been sleeping just gaming and his car has mold growth and mushrooms in the floor boards.... his mouth is badly infected from lack of hygiene... he canceled all my therapy appointments for the next two months .... and he's due to potentially go to jail in September he refused council for court ... I cry every day.... I'm so alone and sad and overwhelmed and I just want to be in my tiny home but I cannot build it myself ... anyway still planning an unassisted but will probably be totally and utterly alone with me and my two small kids which is .... sad to say the least and probably end up having it on a beach somewhere because I'm legitimately homeless
