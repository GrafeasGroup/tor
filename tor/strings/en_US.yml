    If you would like to transcribe this post, please respond to this comment with `claiming` or `claim`. I will automatically mark this post as in progress so that only one person is working on a post at any given time. **Please check that the post does not break the parent sub’s rules before claiming.**


    When you're done, please comment again with `done`. Your flair will be updated to reflect the number of posts you've transcribed and the post will be marked as completed.

      The post is yours! Best of luck and thanks for helping!

      Since this is your first one, please make sure to message the mods if you have any questions about the process (and / or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZDDE3Pj) to talk to other volunteers). We're here to help!

      Please respond with `done` when complete so we can check this one off the list!

      We have a complete tutorial that shows how to transcribe step-by-step and how to fix the most common issues. We suggest you to look at it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/tutorial)!

      The post is yours! Best of luck and thanks for helping!

      Does this post break the rules? Please report it! If you don't want this post anymore (or can't complete it), respond to this comment with `unclaim`.

      Please respond with `done` when complete so we can check this one off the list!
    already_claimed: |
      I'm sorry, but it looks like someone else has already claimed this post! You can check in with them to see if they need any help, but otherwise I suggest sticking around to see if another post pops up here in a little bit.
  done:
    not_claimed_by_user: |
      It does not appear that you have claimed this post! This can be either because this post is not claimed at all or by someone else! If you are unable to resolve this situation, please message the mods.
    already_completed: |
      This post has already been marked as completed! Why not hit the queue for a new post?
    completed_transcript: |
      Awesome, thanks for your help! I'll update your flair to reflect your new count.

      If you want to help keep these bots running, please consider [donating via Patreon or Stripe](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/donations)!
    cannot_find_transcript: |
      Sorry; I can't find your transcript post on the link. Please message the mods to have them look at this.

      Alternatively, did you remember to put the footer in your comment? _Make sure_ that you're copying and pasting the footer as it's shown, complete with all the special characters!

      If the footer is correct, have you tried replying "Done" again after one-two minutes? Sometimes, freshly posted transcriptions are not seen by the bot, so trying again should fix the issue.

      If it still doesn't work, it could be the sign of another bug; let us know by [sending a Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit&subject=Transcription%20Issue&message=) so we can take a look!

      Thanks for letting me know! It looks like the content to transcribe has been removed, so I removed the post on our side. Cheers!

      I can't process an unclaim on a post that's already been completed!

      Hi there! Please read and accept our Code of Conduct so that we can get you started with transcribing. Please read the Code of Conduct below, then respond to this comment with `I accept`.

    transcript_on_tor_post: |
      Hi there! I might be wrong, but I think you just posted a transcription in reply to me. The transcription should be made as a top-level comment on the material that you're working on transcribing; for example, if the content is on r/nicegirls, then the transcription should be commented as a reply to that submission on r/nicegirls. After you've commented there, come back to me and reply with `done` and I can process it!

      Want a handy checklist to help keep track of everything? Check it out [HERE!](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/checklist)

      Don't forget to follow the formatting that I link above, and don't be shy to ask for assistance in either our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZDDE3Pj) or [message the mods!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit&subject=Transcription%20Help&message=)

      Cheers!

      Hi there! Thanks for pinging me!
