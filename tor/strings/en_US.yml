    cannot_find_transcript: |
      ⛔ Sorry, I **can't find** your transcription on the post. Please take the following actions:

      - Make sure that you posted the transcription on the partner subreddit, not on r\/TranscribersOfReddit.
      - Make sure you have switched the comment editor from the default "Fancy Pants" to "Markdown Mode". If there's a "Markdown Mode" button in your comment box, click that.
      - Make sure you are using our [formatting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/guidelines) for your transcription. If you do not include the footer in your transcription, the bot won't find it!
      - Try replying `done` to me again in a minute or two. In some cases Reddit is updating slowly and it takes some time until I can see your comment.

      **NOTE**: please write `I accept` as-is: variations like `I agree` or `Accept` won't work. Editing the old comment to be `I accept` won't work either.

      After you respond, I'll process your claim as normal. A mod will check in and give you feedback when you’re finished!

    transcript_on_tor_post: |
      ⚠️ Hi there! I might be wrong, but I think you just posted a transcription in reply to me.
      The transcription should be made as a **top-level comment** on the post that you're working on transcribing.
      For example, if the content is on r\/nicegirls, then the transcription should be commented as a reply to that submission on r\/nicegirls.
      After you've commented there, come back to me and reply with `done` and I can process it!

  bold_header: "**Bold header**: You seemed to have made the header bold instead of italic. Please only use one asterisk (`*`) on each side instead of two.

    For example:


    \    *Image Transcription: Tumblr*"
  missing_separators: "**Missing separator**: You appear to be missing the horizontal separators (`---`) after the header and/or before the footer.

    Please note that you might not be able to see them on mobile devices.

    Every transcription must have the following format (note the empty lines between each section):


    \    <header>\n
    \   \n
    \   ---\n
    \   \n
    \   <content>\n
    \   \n
    \   ---\n
    \   \n
    \   <footer>"
  heading_with_dashes: "**Heading with dashes**: It seems like you meant to make a horizontal separator (`---`), but have created a heading (i.e. 'big text') instead.

    The separators require an empty line before and after it, like this:


    \    (empty line)\n
    \   ---\n
    \   (empty line)\n


    If you put it directly after a line of text, it will display as a heading, for example:


    \    Heading\n
    \   ---


    Heading

    ---


    If you actually intended to make a heading, please use the syntax with number signs (`#`), like this:


    \    ## Heading"
  malformed_footer: "**Malformed footer**: The transcription footer seems to be formatted incorrectly. Please copy it exactly as seen in the templates:


    \    ^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index)


    This makes sure that it displays correctly on all devices."
  fenced_code_block: "**Fenced code block**: It looks like you used a fenced code block, i.e. you surrounded your code by three backticks, like this:


    \    ```\n
    \   int x = 0;\n
    \   int y = x * 100;\n
    \   ```


    Unfortunately, this doesn't render correctly on all devices. Instead, please prefix every line by four spaces, like this:


    \    int x = 0;\n
    \   int y = x * 100;"
  incorrect_line_break: "**Incorrect line break**: You seem to be using double-spaced or escaped line breaks, please use paragraph breaks instead like this:\n
  
    \    Paragraph line break:\n
    \   \n
    \   This is a line\n
    \   \n
    \   This is another line\n

    \   This is a line  \n
    \   This is another line\n
    \   \n
    \   Escaped line break:\n
    \   This is a line\\\n
    \   This is another line"
  unescaped_username: "**Unescaped username**: You seem to have forgotten to escape a username, i.e. you used `u/username` or `/u/username`.
    Unfortunately, this gives the user a notification and might annoy them.

    Therefore, please escape the username with a backslash (`\\`), for example `u\\/username` or `\\/u/username`."
  unescaped_subreddit: "**Unescaped subreddit name**: You seem to have forgotten to escape a subreddit name, i.e. you used `r/subreddit` or `/r/subreddit`.
    Unfortunately, this might give the sub's mod a notification and could annoy them.

    Therefore, please escape the subreddit name with a backslash (`\\`), for example `r\\/subreddit` or `\\/r/subreddit`."
  unescaped_heading: "**Unescaped heading syntax**: It looks like you intended to transcribe a hashtag, but made it a heading (big text) instead. This is caused by not escaping the number sign (`#`) in front of the hashtag. For example:


    \    #Text


    would render as:


    #Text


    To fix this, add a backslash in front of the `#` like so: `#Text`. If you meant for it to render as a heading, please add a space after the `#` to avoid this warning. i.e. `# Text`."
  invalid_header: "**Invalid header**: It looks like your header doesn't contain a proper type (Image, Video, or Audio), is missing italics, and/or is not at the start of your transcription. Please make sure your post contains a proper header at the start of your transcription. For example if it's an Image Transcription, it should be the following at the start of your transcription:


    \    *Image Transcription: Example*


    same goes for Video or Audio (but with the word `Image` replaced)."
  reference_link: "**Reference link**: It looks like you may have inadvertently used a reference link in your transcription. Reference links usually don't display properly so it's important to escape the corresponding formatting. Here is an example of a reference link format (the end can be text too, and it'll still trigger):
  
  
    \    [test]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test
    
    
    Here's what accidentally using this formatting may look like in a transcription:
    
    
    \    [*Redacted*]: Hello there!
    
    
    To fix this, you simply need to escape the formatting (adding a `\\` in front), here's the above example fixed:
    
    
    \    \\[*Redacted*]: Hello there!"

    ℹ️ **Tip**: {tip_message}
  collection:
    - Do you feel overwhelmed with a transcription or need to ask a question? Respond with `help` and I will summon a moderator to assist you!
    - You can join r/ToR_Meta or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZDDE3Pj) for announcements, meta discussions and memes!
    - r/TranscribersOfReddit is part of the nonprofit organization [GrafeasGroup](https://grafeas.org/). If you want to support our cause, you can [make a donation here](https://grafeas.org/posts/giving-to-grafeas/). The money is used to pay for our bots and servers.
    - Quality over quantity! Remember that one high quality transcription has a lot more value than ten rushed ones!
    - Visually impaired people can use screen readers to access the internet. These are programs which read the text on the screen out loud. They can't read any images or videos, but our transcriptions make them accessible!
    - We use Reddit-flavored Markdown to format our transcriptions. You can view the full documentation about the format on [this wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown).
    - If the post you claimed breaks any rules or you don't want to transcribe it after all, simply reply `unclaim` to me and you can move on to the next one!
    - As you transcribe more and more, you unlock new ranks that change your flair color. You can see a full list of the ranks and the gamma needed to unlock them in the sidebar.
    - Do you want transcriptions on a particular subreddit or are you a moderator of a sub that wants to partner with us? [Write us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TranscribersOfReddit)!
    - If you are an experienced transcriber and over 18 years old, you can [apply to be a moderator](https://forms.gle/EDVfoxHanRASqwCg6). Whenever we need more mods, we look through all the applications to find the best fit for our team.
    - Remember that we are visitors on our partnered subreddits! Please remember to follow the sub's rules and be polite to the other Redditors.
    - Did the OP of the post already provide a transcription of the image? Reply `unclaim` to me and report the post on our end as "Original Post already has a transcription" so that we can save work on this one!
