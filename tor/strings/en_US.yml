I will automatically mark this post as in progress so that only one person is working on a post at any given time. **Please check that the post does not break the parent sub’s rules before claiming.**


    When you're done, please comment again with `done`. Your flair will be updated to reflect the number of posts you've transcribed and the post will be marked as completed.

      The post is yours! Best of luck and thanks for helping!

      Since this is your first one, please make sure to message the mods if you have any questions about the process (and / or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZDDE3Pj) to talk to other volunteers). We're here to help!

      Please respond with `done` when complete so we can check this one off the list!

      We have a complete tutorial that shows how to transcribe step-by-step and how to fix the most common issues. We suggest you to look at it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/tutorial)!

      The post is yours! Best of luck and thanks for helping!

      Does this post break the rules? Please report it! If you don't want this post anymore (or can't complete it), respond to this comment with `unclaim`.

      Please respond with `done` when complete so we can check this one off the list!
    already_claimed_by_self: |
      You already claimed this post!

      If you completed and posted your transcription on the partner sub, reply `done` to me so we can check this one off the list!
    already_claimed_by_someone: |
      I'm sorry, but it looks like u\/{claimed_by} has already claimed this post!

      You can check in with them to see if they need any help, but otherwise I suggest sticking around to see if another post pops up here in a little bit.
    too_many_claims: |
      Woah, slow down there! Please complete your other claimed posts first before starting a new one:

      {links}

      If you already completed them, reply `done` to me there. If you don't want them anymore, you can use `unclaim`.

      If you need help, reply `help` and I will get a human to assist you!
  done:
    not_claimed_by_user: |
      It does not appear that you have claimed this post! This can be either because this post is not claimed at all or by someone else! If you are unable to resolve this situation, please message the mods.
    already_completed: |
      This post has already been marked as completed! Why not hit the queue for a new post?
    completed_transcript: |
      Awesome, thanks for your help! I'll update your flair to reflect your new count.

      If you want to help keep these bots running, please consider [donating via Patreon or Stripe](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/donations)!
    cannot_find_transcript: |
      Sorry; I can't find your transcript post on the link. Please message the mods to have them look at this.

      Alternatively, did you remember to put the footer in your comment? _Make sure_ that you're copying and pasting the footer as it's shown, complete with all the special characters!

      If the footer is correct, have you tried replying "Done" again after one-two minutes? Sometimes, freshly posted transcriptions are not seen by the bot, so trying again should fix the issue.

      If it still doesn't work, it could be the sign of another bug; let us know by [sending a Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit&subject=Transcription%20Issue&message=) so we can take a look!

    coc_not_accepted: |
      Hi there! Please read and accept our Code of Conduct so that we can get you started with transcribing. Please read the Code of Conduct below, then respond to this comment with `I accept`.

      **NOTE**: please write `I accept` as-is: variations like `I agree` or `Accept` won't work. Editing the old comment to be `I accept` won't work either.

      After you respond, I'll process your claim as normal. A mod will check in and give you feedback when you’re finished!

    transcript_on_tor_post: |
      Hi there! I might be wrong, but I think you just posted a transcription in reply to me. The transcription should be made as a top-level comment on the material that you're working on transcribing; for example, if the content is on r/nicegirls, then the transcription should be commented as a reply to that submission on r/nicegirls. After you've commented there, come back to me and reply with `done` and I can process it!

      Want a handy checklist to help keep track of everything? Check it out [HERE!](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/checklist)

      Don't forget to follow the formatting that I link above, and don't be shy to ask for assistance in either our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZDDE3Pj) or [message the mods!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit&subject=Transcription%20Help&message=)

      Hi there! Thanks for pinging me!

If there's something that you would like assistance with, please post a link to that content on /r/DescriptionPlease, and one of our lovely volunteers will be along shortly.

      Thanks for using our services! We hope we can make your day a little bit better :)

      Hi there! Thanks for messaging me!

      Unfortunately I'm a bot and so I can't help you out myself. I've forwarded your message to the moderators so they can help you out! They should message you shortly. In the future, you can [message the mods at this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit&subject=Transcription%20Help&message=) to reach them directly.

      Cheers!

    Please try to fix them and simply **comment `done` again** afterwards:

    If you are overwhelmed by the issues or require assistance, **reply with `help`** and I will get a human to help you out!"
  bold_header: "**Bold header**: You seemed to have made the header bold instead of italic. Please only use one asterisk (`*`) on each side instead of two.

    For example:


    \    *Image Transcription: Tumblr*"
  missing_separators: "**Missing separator**: You appear to be missing the horizontal separators (`---`) after the header and/or before the footer.

    Please note that you might not be able to see them on mobile devices.

    Every transcription must have the following format (note the empty lines between each section):


    \    <header>\n
    \   \n
    \   ---\n
    \   \n
    \   <content>\n
    \   \n

    \   <footer>"
  separator_headings: "**Separator as heading**: It seems like you meant to make a horizontal separator (`---`), but have created a heading instead.

    The separators require an empty line before and after it, like this:


    \    (empty line)\n
    \   ---\n
    \   (empty line)\n


    If you put it directly after a line of text, it will display as a heading, for example:


    \    Heading\n
    \   ---


    Heading

    If you actually intended to make a heading, please use the syntax with number signs (`#`), like this:


    \    ## Heading"
  malformed_footer: "**Malformed footer**: The transcription footer seems to be formatted incorrectly. Please copy it exactly as seen in the templates:

  fenced_code_block: "**Fenced code block**: It looks like you used a fenced code block, i.e. you surrounded your code by three backticks, like this:

    \   int x = 0;\n
    \   int y = x * 100;\n

    Unfortunately, this doesn't render correctly on all devices. Instead, please prefix every line by four spaces, like this:
