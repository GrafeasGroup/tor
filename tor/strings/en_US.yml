      Hi there! Please read and accept our Code of Conduct so that we can get you started with transcribing. Please read the Code of Conduct below, then respond to this comment with `I accept`.

    transcript_on_tor_post: |
      Hi there! I might be wrong, but I think you just posted a transcription in reply to me. The transcription should be made as a top-level comment on the material that you're working on transcribing; for example, if the content is on r/nicegirls, then the transcription should be commented as a reply to that submission on r/nicegirls. After you've commented there, come back to me and reply with `done` and I can process it!

      Want a handy checklist to help keep track of everything? Check it out [HERE!](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit/wiki/checklist)

      Don't forget to follow the formatting that I link above, and don't be shy to ask for assistance in either our [Discord](https://discord.gg/b5DqZXq) or [message the mods!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit&subject=Transcription%20Help&message=)

      Cheers!

      Hi there! Thanks for pinging me!

      Due to some changes with how Reddit and individual subreddits handle bots, I can't be summoned directly to your comment anymore.

      Thanks for using our services! We hope we can make your day a little bit better :)
