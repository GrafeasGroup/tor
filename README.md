# Transcribers of Reddit

This is the source code for the bot moderating and managing several parts of the subreddit
/r/TranscribersOfReddit, a community dedicated to transcribing images, audio, and video.
It acts under the username "/u/TranscribersOfReddit".

Among other things, this bot handles:

- Posting transcription requests to /r/TranscribersOfReddit as relevant content shows up on partner subreddits
- Responding to transcribers claiming and marking requests as complete
- Augmenting the score of a transcriber upon successful completion of a transcription

## Requirements

Redis (tracking completed posts and queue system)
Reddit API keys

> **NOTE:**
>
> This code is not complete. The praw.ini file is required to run the bots and
> contains such information as the useragents and various secrets. It is built
> for Python 3.6.

## Installation

Make sure you have an [up-to-date copy of pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and Python 3.6.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/TranscribersOfReddit/TranscribersOfReddit.git tor
$ cd tor/
$ pip install --process-dependency-links .
```

OR

```
$ pip install --process-dependency-links 'git+https://github.com/TranscribersOfReddit/TranscribersOfReddit.git@master#egg=tor-0'
```

## Big Picture

Triggered flow (via bot inbox):

- If username mention in a comment:
  - Grab id of mentioned post's parent
  - Make new post on ToR
- If reply to comment (e.g., `claim` or `done`):
  - `claim` - Assigns transcription ownership of the post to the user who first commented this way
  - `done` - Checks for transcription and adjusts flair according to reward system

Monitoring daemon (via subreddit's /new feed):

- For each subreddit that has opted in:
  - Search for audio, video, and image content:
    - Check against whitelist of domain filters
    - Post url to the content back to /r/TranscribersOfReddit

## Usage

```
$ tor-moderator
# => [daemon mode + logging]
```
